#Color Theory GPT-2 for Book Text Generation
This code demonstrates how to train and use a GPT-2 model to generate text based on the text data of a book.

Requirements
To run this code, you will need to have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
TensorFlow 2.x
Transformers library
You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install tensorflow transformers
Usage
Prepare your book text data by saving it to a text file in the root directory of this project. The file should be named book_text.txt.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this project.

Run the following command to train the GPT-2 model on the book text data:

python train.py
This will preprocess and tokenize the text data, define the GPT-2 model architecture, set up the training process, and train the model on the text data. The training process may take several hours or more depending on the size of the text data and the computing resources available.

Once the model is trained, you can generate text based on a prompt using the following command:
lua

python generate.py --prompt "What is the meaning of life?"
Replace the prompt text with your own prompt. The generated text will be printed to the console.

Customization
You can customize the behavior of the GPT-2 model by modifying the code in the train.py and generate.py files. For example, you can adjust the hyperparameters of the model or modify the input and output formats.
